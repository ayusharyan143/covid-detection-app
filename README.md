## üìù Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application designed to aid in the preliminary screening of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. It leverages the power of deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to distinguish between X-rays of COVID-19 positive patients and healthy individuals. The application allows users to upload an image and select from four different pre-trained models, receiving a prediction, confidence score, and inference time in seconds.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Model Selection**: Choose from four distinct, trained deep learning models (Custom CNN, VGG16, Xception, ResNet50).
- **High Accuracy**: The top models achieve over **95% accuracy** on the test dataset.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Get instant classification results upon uploading an image.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Results include the prediction, a confidence score, the model used, and inference time.
- **Fully Deployed**: The application is live and accessible online via Render.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive UI for easy image uploads and result viewing.

## üß† Models & Performance

Four different models were trained and evaluated on the same dataset to compare their performance. The VGG16 architecture and the Custom CNN provided the best results.

| Model             | Test Accuracy |
| ----------------- | :-----------: |
| ü•á **VGG16** |   **95.19%** |
| ü•à **Custom CNN** |   **95.05%** |
| ü•â **Xception** |   **90.50%** |
| **ResNet50** |   **73.81%** |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* Git

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ayusharyan143/covid-detection-app.git](https://github.com/ayusharyan143/covid-detection-app.git)
    cd covid-detection-app
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
